Hey there! Inspired by the https://paperswithcode.com/[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/ "Papers with Code") effort, I created a small instance of this for search and recommender systems research papers that I found the code available on Github: https://felipemoraes.github.io/se-recsys-paperswithcode/.


Another interesting effort I follow for years now is the [GitXiv](http://www.gitxiv.com/ "GitXiv"). 

In my humble version, I collected a few papers that I encountered during my research that are available on Github. These papers are mainly from SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, EMNLP, ECIR, ICTIR conferences. 

A plus is that I finally released the code I programmed during my master [here](https://github.com/felipemoraes/dynamic).

I encourage pull requests or issues (with yours or from others papers with code) to make this small effort huge!
